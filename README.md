# Gatsby Bootcamp

---

## A Gatsby tutorial by Andrew Mead

---

Created using Gatsby CLI

Encountered issues:

- Internal links detected by Link as external links. Caused by the "." that precedes slashes (/) when defining directory path.

- .env-cmd issue --- file ".env.development" isn't loaded so renamed it to ".env" as suggested by a user on Stackoverflow. Worked.

- Data set did not update after installing 'gatsby-transformer-remark'. Caused by me not saving gatsby-config.js before running 'gatsby develop/npm run develop'.
